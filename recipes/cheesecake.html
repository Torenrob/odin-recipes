    <h2>A dreamy, decadent, rich, smooth and utterly delicious cheesecake topped with cherry topping!</h2>

    <p>Cheesecake is rich dessert that everyone loves. We’re talking dreamy, decadent, creamy, delicious bliss. It’s no surprise that cheesecake is my favorite dessert. Which is why I don’t make it often. I can’t help myself from eating it. If I know there’s cheesecake in my fridge, that’s all I can think of.

    <p>However, for your sake, my readers, I made this gorgeous New York Style Cheesecake. Because let’s face it. New York Cheesecake is the best kind.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
      <li>½ cup butter (unsalted, melted)</li>
      <li>40 ounces cream cheese (softened, at room temperature (5 packages of 8 oz each))</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar (granulated)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>19 fluid ounce cherry pie filling ((1 can))</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325°F. </li>
      <li>Add the graham crackers to a food processor and pulse a few times until crumbs form. Add the melted butter and pulse a few more times. Transfer the crumb mixture to a 9-inch springform pan and press firmly onto the bottom of the pan. Use a measuring cup to firmly press the crumbs into the pan, it’s much easier.</li>
      <li>Place the pan into the preheat oven and bake for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Beat the cream cheese, sugar, flour, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth and there are no visible clumps. Mix in the sour cream.</li>
      <li>Add the eggs, one at a time and mix on low speed until well blended. Do not over mix. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and remix as necessary. Pour this batter over the baked crust.</li>
      <li>Make a water bath: The prevent the cheesecake from leaking, wrap the bottom of the springform pan with aluminum foil. Cut two long pieces (about 20 inches) of foil and place them on top of each other perpendicularly. Place the springform pan on top of the foil and fold up and crimp the sides to cover the bottom of the pan.</li>
      <li>Place the springform pan into a larger roasting pan and fill the pan halfway with boiling water, make sure it doesn’t go over the foil.</li>
      <li>Transfer the big roasting pan into the oven and bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes. To check if the cake is done, shake the pan and the cake should pretty much be set, except for the center which should still jiggle slightly.
      </li>
      <li>Turn off the oven and leave the oven door open. Let the cake cake cool in the oven until it comes to room temperature. This should prevent cracks.</li>
      <li>Once the cake is cooled completely, refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight. This helps the cake set.</li>
      <li>Top the cheesecake with the cherry pie filling. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
